In this folder we learn about json file and how we work with json....

Json => JSON (javascript object notation) for storing and transporting data.

-> json is often used when data is send from a server to webpage or client.
 example--- 
{
    'name' : 'Ujjwal',
    'sername' : 'kushwaha'
}

** note that -> this is not an object and any object method does not work with json

Json has only two methods........................

-> const jsonData = JSON.stringify(obj); for ojb to JSON
-> const objData = JSON.parse(jsonDataa); for JSON to Obj
